   ###                      THE PROPOSED BACKOFF ALGORITHM
   
   
   Here, First we compared the backoff time and the frame lost of THE PROPOSED BACKOFF ALGORITHM and Slow-Start Backoff Algorithm.
   * First using 500 bits =>
   * And, Errors Streams means No. of Unsuccessful frames in a continuation.

* Here, we have taken 1000 bits =>
