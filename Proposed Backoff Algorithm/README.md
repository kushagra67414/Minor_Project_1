   * Here, First we compared the backoff time and the frame lost of THE PROPOSED BACKOFF ALGORITHM and Slow-Start Backoff Algorithm.
   
   > 1th error stream means = 1 Unsuccessful frame(no of 0's are 1) 
   
   > 2th error stream means = 2 Unsuccessful frames(no of 0's are 2)
   
   > 3th error stream means = 3 Unsuccessful frames(no of 0's are 3)
  
  * And, Errors Streams means No. of Unsuccessful frames in a continuation(0 = implies unsuccessful).



* First using 500 bits =>

* Here, we have taken 1000 bits =>

## USING LINE GRAPH ANALYSIS BETWEEN THE PROPOSED BACKOFF ALGORITHM AND SLOW-START BACKOFF ALGORITHM


* First => Backoff time with respect to no of error stream =>

* Second => Fame Lost with respect to no of error stream =>
